h1. Dependently typed logic programming in meta-haskell!

h2. Overview

An example of using dependently typed logic programming in haskell's 
type system to do theorem proved template black magic without templates.


h2. Details:

A big step semantics for lazy lambda 
calculus on types used on class logic programming, 
and an Isomorphism class which forces a class and 
instances under different data types to be isomorphic 
to a GADT with constructors such that we the class 
can not be instanced elsewhere with more datatypes.
